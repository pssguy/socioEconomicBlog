##  <span class="post">UK Library Borrowings</span>
*9th March 2016*

Many websites provide text or tables solely in pdf format. This makes it difficult to access the underlying data
and may be due to ignorance, lack of time/desire to help out developers or intended to make scraping more difficult    

However, there has been some progress on this front, and I am using the [pdftools package](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools) recently released by Jeroen Ooms under the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) banner. He has recently written a [blog post](http://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/01/pdftools-and-jeroen?utm_source=rOpenSci+Blog&utm_campaign=3a49573252-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d78520d99e-3a49573252-147346145) about it

One of these pesky websites is that of the UK Public Lending Right, [PLR](https://www.plr.uk.com/allAboutPlr/whatIsPlr.htm) whose main function is to ensure that authors get some income from their books being loaned

They have a set of pdf pages which list the most popular authors in each year going back to 1990

```{r 160309 libraries,  echo=TRUE, include= FALSE}

## currently this cannot be loaded on shinyapps.io
#library(pdftools)

```

Click on the code button, if you wish to see the way I have downloaded and tried to make sense of the data. I have set eval=FALSE so the code does not run

```{r 160309 download and pre-process,  echo=TRUE, eval= FALSE}

# download the latest set of pdf pages and save to a temp file
download.file("https://www.plr.uk.com/mediaCentre/mostBorrowedAuthors/top250Authors/2014-2015Top500Authors.pdf", "authors.pdf", mode = "wb")

# extract the text
authorsText <- pdf_text("authors.pdf")

# This results in a character vector - each value the text for the whole page e.g

authorsText[1]
# [1] "  MOST BORROWED AUTHORS\r\n  JULY 2014 - JUNE 2015\r\n  (Adult & Children Combined)\r\n                                 Adult/\r\n          Name                   Child\r\n     1.   James Patterson        A\r\n     2.   Julia Donaldson        C\r\n     3.   Daisy Meadows          C\r\n     

# Not very pretty, but manageable making use of the stringr package
# No doubt there are better ways - but this is still pretty fast


for (j in 1:length(authorsText)) {

 a <-str_split(authorsText[j],"\r\n")  
 b <-unlist(a) 
 if(j!=1) {
 b <- b[3:53] ## early lines do not include author information
 } else {
 b <- b[6:45]  ## and the first page also includes headers
 }
 
# set empty vectors
author <- character()
category <- character() # Adult, Child or both


 
 for(i in 1:length(b)) {
 
   a <-b[i] %>% 
     str_replace_all("[0-9]","") %>% 
     str_replace_all("[.]","") %>% 
     str_trim()
   
   l <-nchar(a)
   
  # example value
    # "     1.   James Patterson        A"
   
   author[i] <- a %>%
     str_sub(1,l-4) %>%
      str_trim()

   category[i] <- a %>%
     str_sub(l-3,l) %>%
     str_trim()
  
 }

tempdf <- data.frame(author,category,stringsAsFactors=F)

if (j!=1) {
  df <- rbind(df,tempdf)
} else {
  df <- tempdf
}

}

df <- df[1:502,]  ## still a few issues df$category
df <- df[df$category!="",]
df <- df[!is.na(df$category),]
df2014 <- df
df2014$year <- 2014


## rinse and repeat for all years - with modifications in code as required
## and combine. Earlier years only listed around 100 authors

borrowings <-bind_rows(df1990,.....,df2014)

# save all data
# Though it did require re-opening with some final minor corrections to data
write_csv(borrowings,"data/borrowings.csv")

```

The result is a pretty unexciting data.frame with three columns, author, category and year
Let's have a look at some of the consistently popular authers over the past quarter-century

```{r 160309 process ,  echo=TRUE}

## read back in the data.frame

borrowings <- read_csv("data/borrowings.csv")

# lets calculate the rank for every year
borrowings <- borrowings %>% 
  filter(!is.na(author)) %>% # still some issues that would need to be sorted if important issue
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(rank=row_number())
  
# print(glimpse(borrowings))
   
  # always in top 100
always <-borrowings %>% 
  filter(rank<=100) %>% 
  group_by(author) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n==25)

#print(nrow(always)) # Just 7

# restrict the borrowings data to these authors
topAuthors <- always$author



```

Turns out there are only seven so  we can easily do an uncluttered plot

```{r 160309  chart,  echo=TRUE}
# plot their popularity over the years

borrowings %>% 
  filter(author %in% topAuthors) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  plot_ly(x=year,y=rank,markers="lines", color=author) %>% 
  layout(hovermode = "closest",
         title="Authors who have been in top 100 most borrowed from UK Libraries in each of past 25 years",
         titlefont=list(size=14),
         xaxis=list(title=""),
         yaxis=list(title="Rank",autorange="reversed")
         )
  
  

```

Of the original top 10, children's author, Enid Blyton - who has been dead almost 50 years -
currently occupies the highest position

##  <span class="post">OECD - migration</span>
*8th March 2016*


The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It consists of 34 of the richest countries in the World

The [OECD stats site](http://stats.oecd.org/#) has a wide range of tables with many different themes and I thought it would be a useful companion to the interactive ability provided by the [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) range of charts. The RopenSci guys have created the plotly R package to ease things along


One major item of contention at the moment is the level of immigration (whether refugee or work-driven) and the OECD has 11 tables relating to Migration detailing inflow and outflow by country by year. It should be noted that there is a lot of missing data - particularly pre 21st century

I used Eric Persson's OECD package to download the data but this takes a long time so saved the data in an rds file for subsequent access



```{r 160308 data loading, echo=TRUE}

# read in some pre-processed data
countries <- countrycode_data
countryPops <- read_csv("data/countryPops.csv")
migration_df <- readRDS("data/totalMIG.rds") 
migration_cats <- read_csv("data/categoriesMIG.csv")

# create input values for shiny 
migCats <- migration_cats$id[1]
names(migCats) <- migration_cats$label[1]

minYear <- as.integer(min(migration_df$obsTime))
maxYear <- as.integer(max(migration_df$obsTime))

## lists for map construction

# country border - available but not used as default is ok
l <- list(color = toRGB("grey"), width = 2)

# Use Robinson map projection which distorts at poles which is irrelevant for this purpose
g <- list(
  scope = 'world',
  projection = list(type = 'robinson'),
  showlakes = FALSE
)

```

We can now create the input dialogues. Currently only one table option is on offer but there is a range of years available

```{r  160308 input, echo=TRUE}

    inputPanel(
      selectInput("mig_Category", label="Select Category (1)",migCats),
      sliderInput("mig_years", label="Select Year(s)", min=minYear,max=maxYear,
      value=maxYear, step=1,sep="")
      )

```

With year and table selected, a map and table of immigration flow in by country can be produced

```{r  160308 inflow, echo=TRUE}

data <- reactive({
  
 # Create a couple of data.frames for use in tables/maps
  req(input$mig_Category)
  req(input$mig_years)
  
 
  
  sel_data <-migration_df %>% 
    select(-TIME_FORMAT, -OBS_STATUS) %>%  # remove unnecessary columns
    filter(VAR==input$mig_Category) %>% # reduce to variable of interest
    spread(GEN,obsValue) %>%  # obtain male data
    mutate(MEN=ifelse(is.na(WMN),TOT,TOT-WMN)) %>% # some women data is NA
    gather(key=GEN,value=obsValue,TOT,MEN,WMN) %>% 
    mutate(Year=as.integer(obsTime)) %>%  # further tidying up
    select(Year,From=CO2,Gender=GEN,To=COU,Count=obsValue) %>%  # link to pops
    left_join(countryPops,by=c("From"="countryId","Year"="year")) %>% 
   rename(Population=count)
  

  
  
  byYear <-sel_data %>%
    filter(Gender=="TOT"&Year==input$mig_years&From!="TOT") %>% ## avoid double counting
    group_by(To) %>%
    summarize(Total=sum(Count,na.rm=T)) %>%
    left_join(countries,by=c("To"="iso3c")) %>% 
    select(To,Total,country.name) 

  
  
  info=list(df=byYear,sel_data=sel_data)
  return(info)
  
})

DT::renderDataTable({
  
  data()$df %>% 
    mutate(Year=input$mig_years) %>% 
    left_join(countryPops,by=c("To"="countryId","Year"="year")) %>% 
    arrange(desc(Total)) %>% 
    select(Country,Immigrants=Total,Population=count) %>% 
    #  select(Country=country.name,Immigrants=Total) %>% 
    mutate(OECD_pc=round(Immigrants*100/sum(Immigrants,na.rm=T),1),Country_pc=round(Immigrants*100/Population,1)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(Immigrants)) %>%
    DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = FALSE,info=FALSE)) %>% 
    formatCurrency(c('Immigrants','Population'), digits=0,currency="")
  

})


renderPlotly({

  theTitle <- paste0('Total Immigrants into OECD Countries ',input$mig_years)

  plot_ly(data()$df, z = log10(Total),  locations = To, hoverinfo = "text",
          text = paste(country.name,"<br>",Total),
          type = 'choropleth',  showscale=FALSE,
          color = Total, colors = 'BuGn', showlegend = FALSE, source="mapTo",
          colorbar = list(title = "Immigrants")) %>%
    layout(title = theTitle, geo = g)

})


```
<!-- Unfortunately, at the time of writing plotly only renders maps in a browser. Here is what the latest (2013) data looks like -->

<!-- ![](images/immigrants2013.png) -->

The really cool thing is that any of the countries on the map can be clicked to give a corresponding table and map of where the immigrants have come from.     
There may be issues producing output for earlier years

```{r  160308 outflow, echo=TRUE}

# pickup the clicked country
mapData <- reactive({

  s <- event_data("plotly_click", source="mapTo")
  point <-  s[["pointNumber"]] # as initial index is 0
  
})

 renderPlotly({
  
   if (is.null(mapData())) return()
  
    #simplify code
   df <-data()$df
   sel_data <- data()$sel_data
   
    #get selected country information
   inCountry <-df$To[[mapData()+1]]
   countryName <- df$country.name[[mapData()+1]]
   
   
   mapdf <- sel_data %>% 
     filter(Gender=="TOT"&Year==input$mig_years&To==inCountry&From!="TOT") 
  
   
   theTitle = paste0("Immigrants by Country into ",countryName, " ",input$mig_years)
   
   plot_ly(mapdf, z = log10(Count),  locations = From,hoverinfo = "text",
           text = paste(Country,"<br>",Count), type = 'choropleth',showscale= FALSE,
           color = Count, colors = 'YlOrRd', colorbar = list(title = "Immi")) %>% 
          layout(title = theTitle, geo = g ) 
   
 })

 DT::renderDataTable({
   
   if (is.null(mapData())) return()
 
   
   df <-data()$df
   sel_data <- data()$sel_data
   
   inCountry <-df$To[[mapData()+1]]
   
   countryName <- df$country.name[[mapData()+1]]
   
 
   
   sel_data %>% 
     arrange(desc(Count)) %>% 
     filter(Gender=="TOT"&Year==input$mig_years&To==inCountry&From!="TOT") %>%
     select(Country,Immigrants=Count,Population) %>% 
     mutate(Imm_pc=round(Immigrants*100/sum(Immigrants,na.rm=T),1),Country_pc=round(Immigrants*100/Population,3)) %>% 
     arrange(desc(Immigrants)) %>%
     DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = FALSE,info=FALSE))  %>%
